Overtime & Meal Voucher Entry Form 
Business Rules:
- Clerk specify the overtime duration and reason then submit it for approval to initiate the workflow.
- Upon submission, the system will create record in the "OvertimeRequest" table. Set the value of the following fields in the "Tran_Timesheet_Extra" table:
  * OTApproved = Y (Approved) or N (Rejected)
  * LastUpdateUser = @userID,
  * LastUpdateTime = current system date
  * Comment = value entered in the "Remarks" textbox column in the grid
  * OTReason = selected value of the "OT Reason" drop-down list column in the grid
  * Approved = 0 (Note: The value of this field will be updated after closure of the workflow)

- The submitted overtime records will be removed on the screen since the default view type is "Show unprocessed overtime"
- Tran_Timesheet_Extra record should not be updated upon submission and should be updated only once the workflow is finished.
